## Strawberries

**Questions**

-   Where they are grown? By whom?

-   Are they really loaded with carcinogenic poisons?

-   Are they really good for your health? Bad for your health?

-   Are organic strawberries carriers of deadly diseases?

-   When I go to the market should I buy conventional or organic strawberries?

-   Do Strawberry farmers make money?

-   How do the strawberries I buy get to my market?

## The data

The data set for this assignment has been selected from:

## read and explore the data

Set-up

```{r}
#| label: load libraries and set options
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(knitr)  
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

```

Read the data and take a first look

```{r}
#| label: read data - glimpse 

strawberry <- read_csv("strawberry_10Oct25.csv", col_names = TRUE)

view(strawberry)

glimpse(strawberry)
##Oct25
```

There are 12699 rows and 21 columns.

All I can see from the glimpse is I have date, location, values and coefficients of variation.

Examine the data. How is it organized?

```{r}
#| label: explore organization 1 


## Is every line associated with a state?

state_all <- strawberry |> distinct(State)

state_all1 <- strawberry |> group_by(State) |> count()

## every row is associated with a state

if(sum(state_all1$n) == dim(strawberry)[1]){print("Yes every row in the data is associated with a state.")}

## rm(state_all, state_all1)

```

## remove columns with a single value in all rows

```{r}
#|label: function def - drop 1-item columns

### write your function

## use the function

## strawberry <- drop_one_value_col(strawberry)

## drop_one_value_col(strawberry)

```

## Plan your approach

### To get better look at the data, look at California.

Explore California to understand the census and survey

Write down your conclusions from California data exploration.

### Now return to the entire data set.

take the lessons learned by examinging the California data

Split the census dat from the survey data. drop single value columns

## separate composite columns

## What issues can you address wit this data?

## What do you need to make use of the chemicals data?
